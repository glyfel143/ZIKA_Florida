All genomes were sequenced using Illumina in combination with RNA Access targeted enrichment. Illumina reads were aligned to BeH819015 (KU365778.1 with missing terminal UTR regions filled with sequence from MR766) and new consensus sequences were generated. A minimum of 3x read depth (in support of the consensus base) was required to make a consensus call. Across the different samples, genome coverage ranged from 57% to 99.8%. All samples were collected from patients in the Miami region during July 28 â€“ October 11 2016. 

All data should be treated as preliminary. If you wish to utilize any of these sequences in a publication, please contact jason.t.ladner.ctr@mail.mil. Otherwise, feel free to download and utilize these sequences unrestricted.
